    üìä Generate AI-Powered AICCRA Mid-Year Progress Report
    
    This endpoint generates a mid-year progress report for a specific AICCRA indicator and year.
    The report focuses on progress achieved up to mid-year and is designed for interim reporting cycles.
    
    üéØ Report Type: Mid-Year Progress Report
    
    - Purpose: Track progress achievements up to mid-year
    - Scope: Interim progress assessment and milestone tracking
    - Timeline: Typically covers January-June achievements
    - Use Case: Progress monitoring, mid-year reviews, course correction
    
    üîç How It Works
    
    1. Data Retrieval: Fetches relevant progress data from SQL Server database
    2. Vector Search: Uses OpenSearch to find contextually relevant information  
    3. AI Generation: Leverages AWS Bedrock Claude 3.7 Sonnet to generate the narrative
    4. Quality Assurance: Ensures report follows AICCRA formatting standards
    
    üìà Mid-Year Report Content
    
    Generated reports include:
    - Progress Summary: Mid-year quantitative achievements vs annual targets  
    - Key Deliverables: Research outputs completed by mid-year with DOI links
    - Cluster Contributions: Mid-year activities by regional/thematic clusters
    - Milestone Tracking: Progress indicators and completion percentages
    - Risk Assessment: Challenges and mitigation strategies for remaining year
