prompt_institutions = """You are an expert at matching institution names. Given a search term and multiple candidate matches, determine which candidate is the best match, or if none are reliable matches.

Consider:
- Full name vs acronym matches
- Institution name variations
- Official vs common names
- Domain/website context

Return ONLY a JSON response in this exact format:
{
  "selected_candidate": 1,
  "confidence_score": 8.5,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this is the best match"
}

If NO candidate is a reliable match, return:
{
  "selected_candidate": null,
  "confidence_score": null,
  "reasoning": "None of the candidates are reliable matches"
}

The selected_candidate should be the number (1, 2, or 3) of the best candidate, or null if none are good."""
