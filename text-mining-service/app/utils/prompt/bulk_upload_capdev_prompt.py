Output Fields for Each Result

Result Title
    • title
    • Identify the exact title of the result as stated in the document.
    • If no title is mentioned explicitly, try to infer a concise title that accurately reflects the content of the result.

Result Description
    • description
    • Provide a brief description of the result.

Reporting Year
    • year
    • Extract the reporting year from the document (e.g., "2021", "2022", "2023").
    • If no reporting year is mentioned, do not return the year field in the output JSON.    

Alliance Main Contact Person
    • Extract the contact's name into the following field as an object:
        • main_contact_person: {"name": "..."}
    • Look for any mention or indication of the primary Alliance contact in the document (e.g., "Alliance focal point," "main Alliance contact," "Alliance coordinator," or a named person specifically flagged as responsible).
    • It could be also the person who reported the result.
    • If no specific name or contact is mentioned, do not return the field in the output JSON.

Keywords
    • keywords
    • List relevant keywords in lowercase, as an array of strings.

Reporting Project
    • Refers to the specific project being reported on and contributing to the result. 
    • Extract and split the project code and name into the following fields:
        • contract_code
        • contract_name
    • If no project code or name is mentioned, return an empty string in the output JSON.

Contribution to SDG targets:
    • sdg_targets
    • List all relevant SDG targets mentioned in the document as an array of strings (e.g., ["SDG2", "SDG13", "SDG5"]).
    • Make sure to include the "SDG" prefix followed by the target number (e.g., "SDG1", "SDG2", ..., "SDG17").
    • If no SDG targets are mentioned, do not return the sdg_targets field in the output JSON.

Training Category
    • training_category
    • Refers to the category of training being conducted.
    • It can include:
        • "Training"
        • "Engagement"
    • If the document does not provide enough detail, do not return the training_category field in the output JSON.

Training Duration Validation
    • start_date and end_date should capture the training period as stated in the document (in YYYY-MM-DD format).
    • length_of_training should be calculated as the time elapsed between the start_date and the end_date.
    • Long-term training refers to training that goes for 3 or more months.
    • Short-term training refers to training that goes for less than 3 months.
    • If the document does not provide enough detail about the training duration or dates, do not return the missing field(s) in the output JSON.

Training Type
    • training_type
    • "Individual training"
    • "Group training"

For "Group training," validate and reinforce participant counting by ensuring:
    1. Extract participant lists
        If the document provides a full list of participants (e.g., in an appendix or table), use it to derive counts whenever possible.
    2. Use explicit participant counts
        If the document states explicit participant numbers (total, male, female, non_binary), use those values directly—unless there are contradictions.
    3. Partial gender counts
        • If only some gender counts are specified (e.g., male participants but not female or non_binary):
            • Fill in the known count for each gender.
            • For any missing genders, do not return the field in the output JSON.
            • If total_participants is provided:
        • Ensure the sum of known gender counts matches total_participants. Use the following formula:
            total_participants = 
                (male_participants if explicitly stated in the document, else 0) + 
                (female_participants if explicitly stated in the document, else 0) + 
                (non_binary_participants if explicitly stated in the document, else 0)
        • If there is a discrepancy (e.g., total_participants is 15 but you can only account for 10 across known genders):
            • Keep the known gender counts.
            • Set any missing gender counts to null (do not return the field in the output JSON).
            • Adjust total_participants to reflect the sum of the known counts (in this example, 10). Do not invent additional participants.
        • If total_participants is not provided:
            • Record the known gender counts.
            • Set total_participants to null (do not return the field in the output JSON).
    4. Completely missing gender counts
        If total_participants is present but no gender-specific counts are given, assume:

        {
            "male_participants": null (do not return the field in the output JSON),
            "female_participants": null (do not return the field in the output JSON),
            "non_binary_participants": null (do not return the field in the output JSON)
        }

    5. Names with gender annotations
        If participant names are listed alongside gender details, count each individual accordingly:
        • Increase male_participants for males,
        • Increase female_participants for females,
        • Increase non_binary_participants if someone does not identify as male or female.
    6. Non-negative integer rule
        All participant counts must be non-negative integers (≥ 0). Use null only when the document does not provide the necessary information.

    • If there are multiple partners, they will be separated by commas, and you should list each one as a separate object in the array.
    • If the document does not provide enough detail, do not return the partners field in the output JSON.

Geoscope (Geographical Scope)
    • For each result, specify:
        • geoscope_level:
            • "Global": if the document does not specify a region or country.
