    üîÑ AI Interaction Tracking System
    
    A comprehensive interaction tracking service for monitoring, analyzing, and collecting
    feedback on AI-generated responses across multiple AI services and applications.
    
    üéØ Dual-Purpose Architecture
    
    This service handles two primary functions:
    
    1. Interaction Tracking
    - Records every AI interaction for analytics and monitoring
    - Tracks user inputs, AI outputs, and performance metrics
    - Provides comprehensive interaction history
    
    2. Feedback Collection 
    - Captures user feedback on AI responses when provided
    - Supports both immediate feedback and delayed feedback updates
    - Enables sentiment analysis and satisfaction tracking
    
    Currently Supported AI Services:
    - Chatbot Service: Conversational AI interactions
    - Text Mining: Text analysis and processing services
    
    üöÄ Key Features
    
    - üìù Tracking: Works with any AI service
    - üîç Advanced Analytics: Service-specific and cross-service insights
    - üìä Real-time Monitoring: Track AI service performance and user engagement
    - üîí Secure Storage: DynamoDB with environment separation (test/prod)
    - üìà Scalable Design: Built to handle interactions from multiple services
    - ÔøΩÔ∏è Rich Context Support: Flexible metadata for service-specific insights
    
    üìä Analytics & Monitoring
    
    Cross-Service Analytics:
    - Compare interaction volumes and feedback rates across different AI services
    - Identify which services have the highest user engagement
    - Track performance trends over time
    - Monitor user experience across the AI ecosystem
    
    Service-Specific Insights:
    - Context-aware analytics based on service type
    - Performance metrics tailored to each AI service
    - Custom reporting for different stakeholder needs
    - Improvement recommendations based on interaction patterns
    
    ÔøΩÔ∏è Service Registration
    
    Automatic Service Discovery:
    - New AI services are automatically registered when first encountered
    - Service metadata is stored for analytics and monitoring
    - Context fields are tracked for service-specific insights
    
    Manual Service Registration:
    Services can also be explicitly registered with detailed metadata for
    enhanced analytics and monitoring capabilities.
    
    üìà Future Enhancements
    
    - Real-time Dashboards: Live monitoring of AI service performance
    - Machine Learning Insights: Predictive analytics on interaction patterns
    - API Integrations: Webhooks and real-time notifications
    - Advanced Filtering: Complex queries across multiple dimensions
    
    üîí Security & Privacy
    
    - Secure Storage: All interactions encrypted and stored in DynamoDB
    - Access Control: IAM-based access control for sensitive operations
    - Data Privacy: Configurable data retention and anonymization
    - Audit Trails: Complete tracking of all interaction operations
    
    üìù Data Structure
    
    Comprehensive Interaction Records:
    Each interaction entry captures:
    - Core interaction data (input, output, performance)
    - Optional feedback (type, comments, ratings)
    - Service information (name, context)
    - User context (ID, session, platform)
    - Service-specific metadata (flexible context)
